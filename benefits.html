<li>/following are the benifts of using lora technology:</li>
<li>/LoRa is a low-power,</li>
<li>/long-range wireless communication technology,</li>
<li>/making it highly suitable for urban infrastructure applications like street lighting,</li>
<li>/where reliability, cost-effectiveness, and energy efficiency are key.</li>
<li>/Here are the main benefits of using LoRa in streetlight poles:</li>
<li>/Long-Range Communication :<li>
</li> can cover distances of up to 15 km in rural areas and 3-5 km in dense urban environments.</li>
<li>/This wide range allows a single LoRa gateway to manage hundreds or thousands of streetlight poles across large areas, reducing the need for multiple gateways.</li>
<li>/Low Power Consumption</li>
<li>/Energy Efficiency:</li>
<li>/LoRa devices, including sensors and communication modules,</li>
<li>/consume very little power,<li>
<li>/allowing them to operate for years on battery power.</li>
<li>/This is essential for streetlight poles, where replacing batteries or maintaining power sources regularly can be costly and impractical.</li>
