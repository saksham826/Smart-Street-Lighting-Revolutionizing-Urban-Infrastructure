<li>/IDEA:- If some street lights become</li>

<li>/Linemen spend valuable time manually searching for faults, finding issues, and fixing them, which can take several days to complete. The absence of precise fault location information further complicates the process. over time, it can cause many problems, such as Accidents.</li>

<li>/To overcome these obstacles we have an innovative idea to empower linemen with efficient fault management capabilities, reducing their workload & ensuring timely maintenance and also to Optimize the</li>

<li>/This technology helps to Autodetect the street light fault.</li>

<li>/ save excessive power and that can further use in other work like charging etc</li>

<li>/it reduces the time and work of linemen.</li>

<li>/As it is Low budget technology so Describe your Technology stack here:</li>

<li>/LORA-It provides a significantly greater communication range with low bandwidths than other competing wireless data transmission technologies like WiFi.</li>

<li>/Node MCU: Itis an open-source software and hardware development environment built around an inexpensive System-on-a-Chip (SoC).it can be
