<li>lora technology :</li>
    <li>LoRa (Long Range) technology is an excellent choice for collecting data from smart street lighting poles</li>
<li><given its low-power</li>
<li>long-range communication capabilities:</li>
<li>LoRa operates in unlicensed frequency bands and can transmit data over several kilometers,</li>
sensors :</li>
<li>Each streetlight pole is equipped with various sensors (like light sensors, motion detectors, energy meters, temperature sensors, etc.)</li>
<li>These sensors collect important data</li>
<li>Long-Range Communication :</li>
<li>LoRa supports long-range communication up to 15 kilometers in rural areas or 3-5 kilometers in urban environments,</li>
<li>making it ideal for a city-wide lighting system.</li>
<li>rduino Uno :</li>
<li> Microcontroller for reading and processing sensor data.</li>
 <li>Mesh Network on Poles :</li>
<li> Each pole has sensors and an Arduino (or other microcontroller) to collect data (e.g., light levels, motion detection, energy usage)</li>
